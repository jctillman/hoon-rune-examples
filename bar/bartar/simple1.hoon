:: "Bartar"  |*
::
:: Making a naked generator with it.
::
:: Note that when invoked, this returns
:: things of the same type, while a generator
:: using |= returns entities all rounded
:: up to a generic noun.  This is because
:: Bartar makes a wet generator, bartis makes
:: a dry one.
:: 
:: Example 1:
:: Identity function, which will return
:: something of the same type.
